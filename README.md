# Snake
For my first HTML5 Canvas project I decided to make Snake in an hour! It was fun to try recreating this classic game for the first time.

### How To Play

- Eat red apples to grow your snake.

- Hitting an edge transports your snake to the opposite edge.

- Running into yourself will end the game.

- Refresh to start a new game.

### Controls

Movement
- Arrow Keys (↑,←,↓,→)
- WASD Keys (W,A,S,D)

Pause
- Space Key
